# Paralax Optics Website

Welcome to the digital home of **Paralax Optics** â€” a perfectly legitimate optics company specializing in timeline-adjacent photography, quantum aperture tech, and probably unauthorized dimensional rift experiments.

This site is part of a class project â€” so think of it as a sandbox for satire, responsive design, and dangerous light-bending prototypes.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

- Build a multi-page, responsive website using **HTML and CSS only**
- Explore layout strategies with **Flexbox and CSS Grid**
- Develop a consistent visual and tonal identity (quirky, satirical, slightly ominous)
- Deliver a fully functional site that satisfies all assignment milestones
- Encourage visitors to both laugh and question reality

## ðŸ”§ To-Do (Future Iterations)

- [ ] Explore using CSS tables or grids for lens spec sheets (once tables are introduced)
- [ ] Potential light animations or hover effects for added flair
- [ ] Add favicon and meta tags for polish and SEO
- [ ] Consider background audio clips or voiceovers for interactive elements
