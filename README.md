# Paralax Optics Website

Welcome to the digital home of **Paralax Optics**—a completely legitimate photography and optics company that definitely exists.

This site showcases our (fictional) work in testing and producing experimental visual technology, possibly funded by three government agencies and a very suspicious book club. It’s a class project—so consider it both a creative sandbox and a corporate cover-up.
