                <h1>Field Test: Rift Lens 14 mm in the Exclusion Zone</h1>
                <p><strong>Location:</strong> Zone Δ-7, Former Mining Town (Now Nonlinear Event Site)</p>
                <p><strong>Field Lead:</strong> Dr. Ilsa Grímsson, Aperture Stability Division</p>

                <p>
                    At precisely 0300 hours, the Rift Lens 14 mm was deployed under fog-dense, chronally unstable
                    conditions. Our objective: determine how effectively the lens could maintain edge sharpness while
                    peering into unstable parallel overlays.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Initial results were promising—vivid ruins and temporal phantoms captured simultaneously.
                    One shot included three timelines stitched together in a single exposure. Our intern cried.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Despite one crew member temporarily being replaced with a 2D version of themselves,
                    the lens never faltered. Results: crisp, layered, and deeply unsettling.
                </p>

                <h2>Test Verdict</h2>
                <p>
                    A+ performance in unstable light-space conditions. Side note: time ghosts are not photogenic.

                <h1>Field Test: Interdimensional View Camera in the Arctic Rift Caverns</h1>
                <p><strong>Location:</strong> Subglacial Lab 4B – Arctic Rift Network</p>
                <p><strong>Field Lead:</strong> Dr. Sanjay Patel, Dimensional Optics Division</p>

                <p>
                    The Interdimensional View Camera was deployed 200 meters beneath arctic ice into a naturally
                    occurring rift cavern. With its entangled sensor array locked to Timeline 7-Beta, we began
                    capturing alternate geological formations and inhabitants—several of whom noticed us.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The camera’s Rift-Sync interface allowed us to cycle through dimensions in real time. Notably,
                    Dimension 12-X featured a warmer climate and advanced penguins. They appeared mildly curious
                    about our camera, then vanished.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Phase-conjugate lensing provided startling clarity. Image analysis revealed that one timeline
                    contains a mirror version of our field team—one of whom waved. We did not wave back.
                </p>

                <h2>Test Verdict</h2>
                <p>
                    The camera operated flawlessly. Recommend future deployment with diplomatic penguin translator.
                </p>

                <p><em>All crew returned safely. Timeline residues cleared after decontamination soak.</em></p>
