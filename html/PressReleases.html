            <p><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong><br>

            <p>
                <strong>Rift City, NV —</strong> In a stunning demonstration of both technological progress and incident
                containment,
                Paralax Optics has completed its first public trial of the Rift Aperture Module (RAM-X7), a prototype
                system
                designed to stabilize and visualize alternate timelines through controlled dimensional breaches.
            </p>

            <p>
                While not yet available to the public, the RAM-X7 serves as a developmental platform for future
                consumer-facing
                products such as the Interdimensional View Camera and Rift Lens series. It provides researchers with
                real-time
                photon coherence across dimensional rifts, enabling unparalleled clarity at the edge of known reality.
            </p>

            <p>
                During the trial, the device held stable for 19.3 seconds before an unplanned temporal echo caused a
                momentary
                rift surge — allowing a small group of <em>Compsognathus</em> to emerge from a parallel timeline.
                The breach closed automatically, and the situation was promptly contained.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                “This is exactly the kind of anomaly we train for,” said Dr. Emilia Tran, Director of Rift Stability.
                “We recovered all field data, and no researchers were permanently de-synchronized. Most importantly,
                image fidelity remained intact throughout the event.”
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                Internal footage captured over 900GB of data, including rift distortion patterns, alternate foliage,
                and what appears to be a parallel version of one of our interns wearing Crocs.
                Data analysis is ongoing. The interns have been rewarded with hazard pay and a commemorative patch.
            </p>

            <p>
                The RAM-X7 project remains in active development and continues to inform the design of future optics
                for both public and classified use. Field trials are scheduled to resume next quarter,
                with greater attention to creature-proofing the observation chamber.
