            <h2>Our Origin</h2>
            <p>
                Paralax Optics was founded in the aftermath of a particularly successful science fair project, a
                cold-war-era garage lab, and a classified government mishap involving refracted antimatter.
                Originally operating out of a repurposed missile silo, the company quickly rose to notoriety
                when it successfully photographed a moment that hadn’t happened yet.
            </p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                We exist to challenge the very definition of photography. At Paralax Optics, we believe capturing
                “the moment” isn’t enough — we aim to capture **possible moments**, **nearly-moments**, and
                occasionally **moments from other timelines**. Our work blurs the line between observation and
                participation in reality.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Our Team</h2>
            <p>
                Our core staff includes physicists, photographers, mathematicians, and at least one confirmed oracle.
                While our org chart defies linear description, all divisions are united under a single guiding
                principle: “If it works, it’s innovation. If it breaks, it’s a beta test.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Every staff member is cross-trained in quantum theory, lens calibration, and emergency dimensional
                containment procedures. Team bonding exercises often involve escaping from pocket realities.
            </p>

            <h2>Why Trust Us?</h2>
            <p>
                We’ve partnered with three government agencies, two universities that don’t technically exist, and a
                shadowy book club with excellent funding. Over 10,000 successful field tests. Less than 14% result
                in mild anomalies.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you're reading this, you're either a customer, a future employee, or a temporal duplicate of someone
                who already is. Either way — welcome aboard.
