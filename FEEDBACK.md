1. Each page is designed well and there are no notable usability issues

2. Home page “cards” are not all the same size

3. The background image makes it a little difficult for the text to be read. Mt recommendation is to change the background color to increase the contrast of the text and make it readable 

4. The columns on the field test page and press release pages could maybe use some work. There is no clear issue with them just a little clunky. Recommendation is to maybe use flex boxes to better format the pages.

5. I really like the all the jump to links on the product page.


Changes Implemented:

1. Lightened the background image so it is still visible but not nearly as distracting and prominent. Text is easier to read when over the background.

2. Fixed the problem of the Home page "cards" being different sizes.

3. Changed the column formatting in the Press Releases and Field Tests for a cleaner look.

4. Fixed images in Products with media queries at smaller screens to be above the propduct name
